# Finite Abelian Groups

May 2022. This project was part of my Abstract Algebra course. The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups states that every finite Abelian group can be decomposed into a direct product of its cyclic subgroups. This short paper provides a short introduction to the theorem, as well as a tutorial application of the theorem to the finite Abelian group U<sub>438</sub>, which is of order 144. The computer program Mathematica is used to generate the group U<sub>438</sub>, many of its subgroups, as well as perform operations on elements in these groups.
